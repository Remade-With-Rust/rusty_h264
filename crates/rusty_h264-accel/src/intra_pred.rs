//! **16x16 luma / 8x8 chroma intra prediction** — portable (rip-ASM Phase 5c).
//!
//! Replaces openh264's `WelsI16x16LumaPred{V,H,Dc,Plane}_sse2` and
//! `WelsIChromaPred{V,Plane}_sse2` (the last vendored intra_pred consumers).
//! The predictors are spec §8.3.3 forms — straight row copies (V), per-row
//! broadcasts (H), one average (DC) and a linear ramp (Plane); memory-shaped
//! work LLVM vectorises well, so these are deliberately plain Rust with
//! fixed-size inner loops. They were pinned bit-exact against the live
//! assembly by differential tests BEFORE the asm was ripped (2026-08-12);
//! the tests below now pin against an independent in-test transcription of
//! the same spec formulas.

/// guarantees the needed neighbours exist (both for DC/Plane), exactly the
