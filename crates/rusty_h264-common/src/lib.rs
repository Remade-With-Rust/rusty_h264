//! Shared primitives for the `rusty_h264` pure-Rust H.264 codec.
//!
//! This crate is the foundation both the encoder and decoder sit on. It is
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`: the bit-twiddling core of an H.264 codec is
//! exactly where memory-safety bugs hide in the C implementations, so we keep
//! it provably safe.
//!
//! Modules mirror the concerns shared across `codec/common` in Cisco's
//! openh264:
//! - [`bit_writer`] / [`bit_reader`] — MSB-first bit packing + Exp-Golomb.
//! - [`nal`] — NAL units, Annex-B framing, RBSP emulation prevention.
//! - [`types`] — shared enums and the raw YUV frame container.
